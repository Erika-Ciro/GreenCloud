# Future Work for the GreenCloud Project

This section outlines potential improvements and extensions for the GreenCloud Sustainability Dashboard project:

1. **Advanced Predictive Models**:
   - Implement Gradient Boosting or XGBoost models for more accurate energy trend predictions.
   - Explore deep learning models for time series forecasting of energy consumption and carbon intensity.

2. **Real-Time Data Integration**:
   - Develop pipelines to collect real-time data from cloud providers or public APIs.
   - Enable dynamic updates to the sustainability dashboard.

3. **Energy Alerts System**:
   - Implement a module to send alerts for high energy consumption or carbon intensity spikes.
   - Configure user-defined thresholds for notifications.

4. **High-Fidelity Dashboard**:
   - Transition from a low-fidelity prototype to an interactive, production-ready dashboard using tools like Plotly Dash or Streamlit.

5. **Incorporate External Datasets**:
   - Integrate datasets from other cloud providers (e.g., AWS, Azure) for comparative analysis.
   - Use global energy reports for additional context.

6. **Scalability and Automation**:
   - Automate data preprocessing steps to handle larger datasets and future updates.
   - Optimize ML models for faster training and prediction.

7. **Ethical and Legal Considerations**:
   - Ensure compliance with GDPR and other relevant regulations.
   - Include disclaimers for data usage and limitations.

This document serves as a roadmap for future iterations of the GreenCloud project.
