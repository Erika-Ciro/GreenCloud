# Visuals: Project Analysis and Results  

## Overview  
This folder contains visual representations of the project's data analysis, machine learning results, and system architecture. These visuals illustrate energy consumption trends, carbon intensity distribution, and model performance.  



## Purpose  
The purpose of this folder is to store visual representations that highlight:  
- **Model Evaluation:** Performance metrics of machine learning models (regression and classification).  
- **Data Distribution:** Visualization of Google CFE data and carbon intensity across regions.  
- **System Architecture:** Diagram describing data flow, processing, and visualization.  



## Images  

### 1. `architecture_diagram.png`  
- **Description:** Architecture diagram illustrating the system workflow.  
- **Details:**  
  - Data ingestion from Google Cloud and CSV files.  
  - Data processing and cleaning with Python.  
  - Machine learning model training and evaluation.  
  - Visualization of results in the dashboard prototype.  




### 2. `cfe_distribution.png`  
- **Description:** Histogram of Google CFE distribution.  
- **Details:**  
  - Represents the frequency of CFE values across all locations.  
  - Visualizes the general trend of carbon-free energy usage.  


### 3. `carbon_intensity_distribution.png`  
- **Description:** Histogram of grid carbon intensity (gCO2eq/kWh).  
- **Details:**  
  - Visualizes carbon intensity distribution across regions.  
  - Highlights patterns and anomalies in emission levels.
